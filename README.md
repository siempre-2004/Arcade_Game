# The Dual-Hatted Courtier 🎮  
A story-driven stealth arcade game with physical interaction

**The Dual-Hatted Courtier** is a hybrid physical–digital stealth game where the player lives a double life.  
By day, you are a loyal courier serving the officials.  
By night, you secretly aid the poor—stealing treasures from corrupt lords and redistributing them in silence.

This project was developed as a **custom arcade experience** using **Arduino-based physical controls** and **Unity C# gameplay systems**.  
The game explores **embodied interaction** and **alternative game input**, replacing traditional controllers with **a custom fishing-rod device and color sensor** for tactile stealth control.
